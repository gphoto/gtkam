				     GTKam

Hi!

Thank you for using GTKam and therefore supporting our efforts in providing
free access to information on protocols of digital cameras.

Requirements
------------

GTKam is a GTK-frontend to gphoto2. Therefore, you need at least those two
libraries. If you are using CVS, you can get an old version of gtkam for
GTK+-1.2 by running "cvs update -r gtkam-gtk-1".

If you would like to access EXIF information, libexif(-gtk) must be installed
prior compilation of GTKam. Get libexif and libexif-gtk
from http://www.topfrose.de or directly from
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif.

Authors
-------

GTKam has originally been written by Scott Fritzinger <scottf@unr.edu>.
Lutz Müller <lutz@users.sf.net> rewrote everything using GTK's 
object oriented approach. That made it possible to introduce many new
features.
